<h1> Design </h1>

<p>Welcome to the Design Page, this page will document Css and coding used along with information on  colour and font etc. </p>

<br>
<br>
<h2> Navigation Panel </h2>

<p> The Navigation Panel has been put together and edited to look Modern but not taking up all of the top of the page.</p>
<p>Display below is both the html and css coding behind the navigation panel design, ive coded and designed the navigation panel to look modern but with a style of being hacker created,<br> i got my inspiration from numerous hacker movies.<br>The font used is 'impact' it gives that style of technology in my eyes along with the colours used white and blue.</p>
<div style="padding-left:300px;">
<img src="css_navigation.jpg" height="400px" width="550px" alt="css_navigation">
</div>
<p> The code above displays the Css coding, it was a bit of a task positioning the navigation bar but thanks to the Css it was made easier!</p>
<div style="padding-left:530px;">
<img src="html_navigation.jpg" height="300px" width="500px" alt="html_navigation">
</div>
<p> The html used is very basic but the css adds all the styling too it </p>
<br>
<h2> Hover over image effects </h2>
<div style="padding-left:275px">
<img src="glowing_hover_over.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="hover_over">
</div>
<p> To add some nice hover effects to the pictures on the index page i looked up a tutorial snippit on how to hover over a picture along with make the picture glow when your mouse is over it, this effect looks modern and pretty cool in my eyes so adding it was a must. please see below for the Css.<img src="hover_over_css.jpg" height="300px" width="400px" alt="hover_over css" align="right"></p>

<h2> Colours </h2>

<p>When thinking of colours used on the website again my inspiration came from watching hacker movies , instead of just making a simple Cipher site i decided i wanted to add a bit of a intrequing story to it.<br>The follow colours used are Black,Blue,Red and white, to give unique in a way look. </p>
</div>

<h2> Font used </h2>

<p>The Font used is 'Impact' this font i decided to use for the website because it had that look of technological / binary to it which suited the website theme well</p>
